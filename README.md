# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Used C++ to design a tic-tac-toe game for a user to play against the computer.
Implemented functions that allows the computer to respond when the user is winning or if a win is possible for the computer.
Debugged arrays and loops to make the project run smoothly using Microsoft Visual Studio 2015.
